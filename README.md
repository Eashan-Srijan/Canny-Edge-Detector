# Canny Edge Detector from Scratch

## Introduction
The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. In this project we will develop a Canny-Edge Detector from scratch, including functuionalities like convlution, non-max supression, simple thresholding(for threshold choosen at 25th, 50th and 75th percentile), gradient magnitude, edge angle and gradient angle computations. 

The process of Canny edge detection algorithm can be broken down to following steps:

1. Apply Gaussian filter to smooth the image in order to remove the noise.
2. Find the intensity gradients of the image using Prewitt's Operator.
3. Apply gradient magnitude thresholding or lower bound cut-off suppression to get rid of spurious response to edge detection (Non-max Supression).
4. Apply simple threshold to determine potential edges.

### Step 1: Gaussian Filtering
### Step 2: Gradient Computaion
